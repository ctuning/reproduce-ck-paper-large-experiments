Large, shared artifacts to reproduce and extend techniques from
the following papers on "Collective Mind" and "Collective Knowledge":

* http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06256
* http://hal.inria.fr/hal-01054763
* https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00436029
* http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4075

However, HOG experiments and predictive analytics are a bit
outdated. That's why moved it here.
